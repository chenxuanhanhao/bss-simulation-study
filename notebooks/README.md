# notebooks folder

This folder contains commented jupyter notebooks that can be used to transform the datasets into different shapes. Specifically, they will produce a list of stations with capacities and initial number of available bikes (`extract_stations.ipynb`) and a trips dataset, that includes latent demand (`extrapolate_demand.ipynb`). All the scripts are available as [jupyter notebook]() and python scripts. The python scripts have been generated from the jupyter notebooks using the `Python` extension by Microsoft for Visual Studio Code. When opened in an instance of VS Code , this extension also allow for the execution of the individual cells.
