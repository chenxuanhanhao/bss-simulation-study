# data folder

The datasets are too big for GitHub, so you have to download them seperately from [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3702259). Place the two csv files and license in this folder. Do not change the names of the files, as the rest of the code assumes them (althugh this can be changed by changing the paths).
